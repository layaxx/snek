The sttaic frontend is deployed to Github Pages via the default Github Action proposed by vite <https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#github-pages>, modified to work with `yarn` instead of `npm`.

The database responsible for the highscore leaderboard is hosted on the firebase plattform ([firestore on the free spark plan](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore))
